# World Energy Visualization for IA2

Authors: Pavel Levchenko

## Description of the Dashboard

This is part of the group project for DSCI532 for group-07. My main responsibility was to create overall skeleton of the app, with layout for both tabs, while other team members are responsible for making three types of plots (map, barplot and lineplot).
